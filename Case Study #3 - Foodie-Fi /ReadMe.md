## üìù Background & üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement
Subscription based businesses are super popular and Danny realised that there was a large gap in the market - he wanted to create a new streaming service that only had food related content - something like Netflix but with only cooking shows!

Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!

Danny created Foodie-Fi with a data driven mindset and wanted to ensure all future investment decisions and new features were decided using data. This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions.

## üìÇ Dataset
Danny has shared the data design for Foodie-Fi and also short descriptions on each of the database tables as shown below:

<details>
 <summary> Plans Table Structure </summary>
 <p>
   
**Query #1**
    
    DESCRIBE plans;
    
| Field     | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
| --------- | ------------ | ---- | --- | ------- | ----- |
| plan_id   | int          | YES  |     |         |       |
| plan_name | varchar(13)  | YES  |     |         |       |
| price     | decimal(5,2) | YES  |     |         |       |

Customers can choose which plans to join Foodie-Fi when they first sign up.

* Basic plan customers have limited access and can only stream their videos and is only available monthly at $9.90

* Pro plan customers have no watch time limits and are able to download videos for offline viewing. Pro plans start at $19.90 a month or $199 for an annual subscription.

* Customers can sign up to an initial 7 day free trial will automatically continue with the pro monthly subscription plan unless they cancel, downgrade to basic or upgrade to an annual pro plan at any point during the trial.

* When customers cancel their Foodie-Fi service - they will have a churn plan record with a null price but their plan will continue until the end of the billing period.

**Query #2**

    SELECT * 
    FROM plans;

| plan_id | plan_name     | price  |
| ------- | ------------- | ------ |
| 0       | trial         | 0.00   |
| 1       | basic monthly | 9.90   |
| 2       | pro monthly   | 19.90  |
| 3       | pro annual    | 199.00 |
| 4       | churn         |        |

</details>

<details>
 <summary> Subscriptions Table Structure </summary>
 <p>
   
**Query #3**
    
    DESCRIBE subscriptions;

| Field       | Type | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
| ----------- | ---- | ---- | --- | ------- | ----- |
| customer_id | int  | YES  |     |         |       |
| plan_id     | int  | YES  |     |         |       |
| start_date  | date | YES  |     |         |       |

Customer subscriptions show the exact date where their specific plan_id starts.

If customers downgrade from a pro plan or cancel their subscription - the higher plan will remain in place until the period is over - the start_date in the subscriptions table will reflect the date that the actual plan changes.

When customers upgrade their account from a basic plan to a pro or annual pro plan - the higher plan will take effect straightaway.

When customers churn - they will keep their access until the end of their current billing period but the start_date will be technically the day they decided to cancel their service.

Based on the data above, see below the journey of these 8 sample customers:
| Customer ID      | Journey    |
| -----------      | ---------- |
| 1                | This customer signed up for Foodie-Fi on 01 August and downgraded to basic monthly at the end of the trial period |
|  2               | This customer signed up for Foodie-Fi on 20 September and was automatically upgraded to pro annual at the end of the trial period |

| 19               | This customer signed up for Foodie-Fi on 22 June,  downgraded to pro monthly at the end of the trial period, and eventually  upgraded their subscription to pro annual |


**B. DATA ANALYSIS JOURNEY**

**1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?**

      SELECT
      	COUNT(DISTINCT(customer_id)) AS NumberOfCustomers
      FROM subscriptions;

**2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset? - use the start of the month as the group by value**

     SELECT
     	MONTH(s.start_date) AS MonthNum,
     	MONTHNAME(s.start_date) AS Month,
      COUNT(s.customer_id) AS NumberOfSubs
     FROM subscriptions s
     WHERE s.plan_id = 0
     GROUP BY MonthNum, Month
     ORDER BY MonthNum; 

**3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name?**

     SELECT
     	YEAR(s.start_date) AS FY,
         p.plan_name As Plan,
         COUNT(s.customer_id) As NumberOfSubs
      FROM subscriptions s
      JOIN plans p
      ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
      WHERE YEAR(s.start_date) > 2020
      GROUP BY FY, Plan;

**4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?**

    SELECT
      COUNT(DISTINCT(s.customer_ID)) AS ChurnedCustomers,
      ROUND(100 * COUNT(s.customer_ID) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM subscriptions), 1) AS Percentage
    FROM subscriptions s
    WHERE s.plan_ID = 4
