## üìù Background & üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement
Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

## üìÇ Dataset
Because Danny had a few years of experience as a data scientist - he was very aware that data collection was going to be critical for his business‚Äô growth.

He has prepared for us an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner‚Äôs operations.
You can inspect the entity relationship diagram below:

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Data Wrangling
### Data Issues
After studying the existing table, we notice some data issues in the existing schema. The issues are:
  
I.	Customer_orders table: Null and NaN values in the extras and exclusions columns
  
II.	Runner_orders table: Null and Nan values in pickup_time, distance columns, duration, and cancellation columns; wrong data type for pickup_time, distance, duration, and columns; units manually entered in distance and duration columns

### Data Cleanup
I.	Customer_orders table: 
*	Null and NaN values in the extras and exclusions columns
             
             UPDATE customer_orders
             SET extras = ""
             WHERE extras LIKE "null"
              OR extras IS NULL;

             UPDATE customer_orders
             SET exclusions = ""
             WHERE exclusions LIKE "null";

II.	Runner_orders table: 
* Null and Nan values in pickup_time, distance columns, duration, and cancellation columns
            
            UPDATE Runner_orders
            SET pickup_time = ""
            WHERE pickup_time LIKE "null"
             OR pickup_time IS NULL;

            UPDATE Runner_orders
            SET distance = ""
            WHERE distance LIKE "null"
             OR distance IS NULL;

            UPDATE Runner_orders
            SET cancellation = ""
            WHERE cancellation LIKE "null"
             OR cancellation IS NULL;

            UPDATE Runner_orders
            SET duration = ""
            WHERE duration LIKE "null"
             OR duration IS NULL;

* Units manually entered in distance and duration columns
  
            UPDATE Runner_orders
            SET distance = TRIM(distance, "km")
            WHERE distance LIKE "%km";

            UPDATE Runner_orders
            SET duration = TRIM(duration, "mins")
            WHERE duration LIKE "%mins";

            UPDATE Runner_orders
            SET duration = TRIM(duration, "minute")
            WHERE duration LIKE "%minute";

            WHERE duration LIKE "%minutes";

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Case Study Questions & üöÄ Solutions
This case study has LOTS of questions - they are broken up by area of focus.
  * Pizza Metrics
  * Runner and Customer Experience

### Pizza Metrics
  #### a.	How many pizzas were ordered?
  
              SELECT COUNT(order_id)
              FROM customer_orders;
  
| COUNT(order_id) |
| --------------- |
| 14              |

  #### b.	How many unique customer orders were made?
  
              SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)
              FROM customer_orders;
  
| COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) |
| ------------------------ |
| 10                       |

#### c.	How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?
  
              SELECT runner_id
               ,COUNT(order_id) AS successful_orders
              FROM runner_orders
              WHERE cancellation NOT IN (
                "Restaurant Cancellation"
                ,"Customer Cancellation"
                )
              GROUP BY runner_id;

| runner_id | successful_orders |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| 1         | 4                 |
| 2         | 3                 |
| 3         | 1                 |

#### d.	How many of each type of pizza was delivered?
  
             SELECT pizza_name
              ,COUNT(r.order_id)
             FROM pizza_names p

               ,"Customer Cancellation"

| ---------- | ----------------- |
| Meatlovers | 9                 |
| Vegetarian | 3                 |

#### e.	How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?
  
              SELECT pizza_name
               ,c.customer_id
               ,COUNT(r.order_id)
